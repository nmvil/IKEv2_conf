== iOS ==

A configuration profile is attached as vpn-ios.mobileconfig.

Open this attachment. Then go to Settings > General > VPN & Device Management, and find the profile under 'DOWNLOADED PROFILE'.

You will be asked for your device PIN or password, and then your VPN username and password.

These instructions apply to iOS 15. Earlier (and probably later) versions of iOS will also work, but the exact setup steps may differ.


== macOS ==

In macOS Monterey, your VPN username and password must be embedded in the profile file. However, your password cannot be included in a profile sent by email for security reasons.

So: open vpn-mac.applescript and run it from Script Editor. You'll be prompted for your VPN username and password.

System Preferences will then open. Select the profile listed as 'Downloaded' on the left, and click 'Install...' in the main panel.


== Windows ==

You will need Windows 10 Pro or above. Please run the following commands in PowerShell:

$Response = Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri https://valid-isrgrootx1.letsencrypt.org
# ^ this line fixes a certificate lazy-loading bug: see https://github.com/jawj/IKEv2-setup/issues/126

Add-VpnConnection -Name "101034.ip-ns.net" `
  -ServerAddress "101034.ip-ns.net" `
  -TunnelType IKEv2 `
  -EncryptionLevel Maximum `
  -AuthenticationMethod EAP `
  -RememberCredential

Set-VpnConnectionIPsecConfiguration -ConnectionName "101034.ip-ns.net" `
  -AuthenticationTransformConstants GCMAES256 `
  -CipherTransformConstants GCMAES256 `
  -EncryptionMethod GCMAES256 `
  -IntegrityCheckMethod SHA384 `
  -DHGroup ECP384 `
  -PfsGroup ECP384 `
  -Force

# Run the following command to retain access to the local network (e.g. printers, file servers) while the VPN is connected.
# On a home network, you probably want this. On a public network, you probably don't.

Set-VpnConnection -Name "101034.ip-ns.net" -SplitTunneling $True

You will need to enter your chosen VPN username and password in order to connect.


== Android ==

Download the strongSwan app from the Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.strongswan.android

Then open the attached .sswan file, or select it after choosing 'Import VPN profile' from the strongSwan app menu. You will need to enter your chosen VPN username and password in order to connect.

For a persistent connection, go to your device's Settings app and choose Network & Internet > Advanced > VPN > strongSwan VPN Client, tap the gear icon and toggle on 'Always-on VPN' (these options may differ by Android version and provider).


== Ubuntu ==

A bash script to set up strongSwan as a VPN client is attached as vpn-ubuntu-client.sh. You will need to chmod +x and then run the script as root.
